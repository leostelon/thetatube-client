# Accomplishments/Milestones

 - Support for any user to create and publish NFT's as premium passesüéüÔ∏è.
 - Added DRM support. Token gated contentüö™.
 - Upload upto 1080px videos.
 - Premium purchase using TFUEL.

# Technology
- **Theta Video API** a decentralized video delivery network, we were able to distribute content at scale and also lower our cost to encode, store and deliver video.  [[know more]](https://www.thetavideoapi.com/)
 - **Theta DRM** to token gate content. 
 - **Theta EVM** to store and retrieve subscription based NFT's. 
 - Database,  is handled by **Polybase**, the database for web3. [[know more]](https://polybase.xyz/)
	- Find schemas and logic [here](https://github.com/leostelon/thetatube-client/tree/main/src/database).
- Host and maintained in **Vercel**. [[know more]](https://vercel.com/)
- Thumbnails, profile pictures and media are stored in IPFS using [nft.storage](https://nft.storage/). Visit the docs to get the key if your running it locally.

Follow the below steps to run it locally.
